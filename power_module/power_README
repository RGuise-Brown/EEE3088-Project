Power Module - Micro-Mouse Project (WIP)

This folder contains all the design files, component selection information, and testing procedures related to the power module for our micro-mouse robot.

Project Goal:

The power module aims to efficiently power the robot's motors, manage battery charging, switch the robot on and off and provide the processor with information about the battery level.

Module Requirements(details in project brief and report):

- Deliver sufficient power (up to 200mA per motor) to operate two DC motors using the provided battery.
- Integrate a battery monitoring system to provide an analog voltage signal for estimating the battery's State of Charge (SoC).
- Include a safe and efficient charging circuit that utilizes the 5V input to recharge the battery.
- Implement an on/off switch, minimizing power consumption in the off state (below 500uA) and handling peak current draw when activated.
- Design the PCB to fit the designated space on the provided motherboard and adhere to overall size constraints.

Current Progress (WIP):
Currently, the PCB has been designed and is being developed. Once it arrives, testing of the PCB will start.

Files:
There have been 4 distinct version of the PCB. The main change to each was the switch that was used. The previous versions have been kept to show other design options. Version 2 was discarded becasue it was not feasible. 
- Project_PCB_v1
- Project_PCB_v3
- Project_PCB_v4 (sent for production)
