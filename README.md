# EEE3088-Project
This repository is used for the collaborative project to create a micromouse with the focus on creating a power and sensing unit which will work with an existing structure, motherboard and processor.This project is being completed by Rachael Guise-Brown and Heinrich Crous for EEE3088F at UCT.

Project Overview:

The project involves building subassemblies for a micro-mouse robot designed to navigate a maze within a set time limit. This repository focuses on the design and fabrication of the following modules:

Power Module: This module will be responsible for powering the motors, charging the battery, switching the robot on and off and providing an indication of the battery level to the processor.
Sensor Module: This module  will be responsible for detecting objects in the maze environment and relaying this information to the processor for navigation purposes.

Folder Structure:
power_module: This folder will contain all schematics, PCB design files, component selection information, and testing procedures related to the power module.
sensor_module: This folder will contain all design files, documentation, and testing procedures related to the sensor module.
documentation: This folder will contain any information documents linked to both power and sensor modules.
